STRATEGIC INNOVATION

Clients come to us with knotty brand or category challenges, requiring the reframing of existing knowledge, a new perspective on their consumer landscape and fresh inspiration. We collect, then weave together, multiple inputs to create a coherent new story, often visually articulated.

Our successful track record lies in helping our clients determine a clear path forward for their brands, by illuminating a picture of the future grounded in deep market understanding, and securing internal alignment.  Our approach helps accelerate the transition from strategy to execution.

What makes Big Green Door Better?
Posted on April 5, 2013 by admin

Management consultancies do a lot of what we do, but are achingly analytic in their approach. Would you trust them to unlock fresh insights? Research agencies cover some of the same territory but are rarely creative enough in their thinking. Would you trust a research agency with your innovation strategy? Design agencies have the visual panache, but would you trust them with your brand strategy?

Why working hard makes a difference.
Posted on April 5, 2013 by admin

BIG GREEN DOOR is all about unlocking the future success of your business, your brands and your products and services. Because we believe that success comes from enquiry and not just a moment of good fortune, we use a wide range of insight tools to find the “keys” that will uniquely unlock the future success of your business. In a nutshell, that’s what BIG GREEN DOOR does and has been doing for many years. And if that’s a cliché, well so be it.

People own brands.

Brands don’t exist in isolation. They are constructed by people and affect the way people behave. Sometimes we call these people consumers, sometimes we call them employees but importantly they are real people not respondents.

COMMUNITY

The BIG GREEN DOOR working community is a diverse group of people with a combined wealth of experience, youthful vitality and specialist knowledge. Most of the team are BIG GREEN DOOR to the core, but from time to time our Associates need time and space to pursue other interests or simply catch up on their lives. We see this as something positive, enriching the community and adding to the vibrancy of the their work.

All our Partners, Associates and core team share the same client-centric perspective, the same mental toughness and determination to get to the root of the issue. The whole team is agile both individually and collectively. What’s more, everyone shares the same understated BIG GREEN DOOR sense of humour and common sense perspective.
